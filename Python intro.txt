* Python:- Python is general purpose popular programming language,it is a high level , interpreted,dynamically typed programming language. 
          It is used to develop software and wed applications.
* High level programming:- High-level programming languages, like Python, provide abstractions that are closer to human languages and concepts, 
                            making them easier to understand and use.
* interpreted:- It reads and interprets the source code line by line, executing the instructions without the need for compilation into machine code. 
                  Python uses an interactive interpreter, allowing users to enter and execute commands directly in an interactive shell or run entire scripts.
* Dynamically typed:-  In a dynamically typed programming language like Python, variable types are determined at runtime, not during compilation.
* Variable:- Variable can be defined as a name of memory storage location.
              Python does not required the variable to be declared.Python internally handles the variable according to them.
* Data type:- Python support the dynamic datatypes i.e at the time of execution of program datatype of variable will be decided based on the data which is assigned to that variable.
              Datatypes:-
                1.numeric
		2.string
                3.list
* Type conversion:- Type conversion in Python refers to the process of changing the data type of a variable from one type to another. Python provides built-in functions to perform type conversion.
                    There are two types of Type Conversion in Python:
                    1.Implicit Type Conversion
                    2.Explicit Type Conversion
 implicit type conversion :-python interpreter automatically assigns a data type to a variable once it is declared.
 explict type conversion :- process of manually converting a value from one data type to another using built-in functions.
                            ex: int(), float(), or str().
